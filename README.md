# Narrative Radar (Solana)

A narrative detection + idea generation tool for the Solana ecosystem.

## Goal
- Detect **emerging narratives** and early signals in the Solana ecosystem (fortnightly)
- Explain *why* each narrative is trending (sources + signals)
- Generate **3–5 concrete build ideas** per narrative

## Planned MVP (fast, shippable)
- Data sources (phase 1):
  - GitHub (repo search + stars/velocity)
  - RSS/blog sources (selected Solana ecosystem feeds)
  - X (optional; needs API access)
- Signal ranking:
  - velocity-based heuristics + lightweight scoring
- Output:
  - Hosted dashboard + JSON export
  - Optional publish-to-GimmeIdea via PAT

## Dev
TBD
